PROJECT TITLE: Max subarray sum
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To find the max subarray 
VERSION or DATE: 17/09/2020
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 
AUTHORS: Mrinal Rana
USER INSTRUCTIONS: The find max subarray finds the start and end index of the suarray with max sum. It's asymptotic time is n*log(n).
           The max subaray linear finds the max sum of a subarray in a linear asymptotic time.
           The crossover for the above two algorithms is around = 20.
           input the array for which you want the max sub array in the form of argument to main fauntion.
